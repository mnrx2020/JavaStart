JavaStart

Project Description

In this project, I created simple Java code to understand:

* Variables and data types
* Conditional statements (if/else)
* Loops (for, while)
* Methods and functions
* Classes and objects
* Java Collections
* Java packages
* Java File Handling

The project serves as an introduction to Java, providing hands-on experience with the language's core concepts.

Features
* Basic Java Syntax: Understanding the basic structure of Java code.
* Object-Oriented Programming: Introduction to classes and objects.
* Loops and Conditionals: Using loops and if statements to control the flow of the program.
* Java packages.
* Java Collections.
* Java File Handling.

Requirements
* Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later.
* IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or command-line tools for compiling and running Java code.
